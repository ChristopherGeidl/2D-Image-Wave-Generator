# 2D-Image-Wave-Generator
A 2 dimensional wave simulation that will find the positions of wave generators in order to make a standing wave that looks like a desired image.

ToDo:
1. Improve frame rate
  a. generate a video rather than in time rendering???
3. Take image input and output a standing wave amplitude matrix
4. Find positions of image generators to form the amplitude matrix
